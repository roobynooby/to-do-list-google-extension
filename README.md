Super basic and simple, click the extension, you'll see "add new task", just click it and type your own list of tasks to do and click save.
You will see it there now as a list.

You can also strike out the task that you are done with by clicking the ✔️ button

SIDE NOTE:
This is really basic and just something fun that I learned about online, it used the users localstorage to store the input information sent by user. There is no backend database that collects any information from any user.
