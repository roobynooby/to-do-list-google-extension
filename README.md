# to-do-list-google-extension
A simple javascript html css google extension that allows users to have a to do list easily accessible

Installation Guide:

2. Open chrome://extensions/ website
3. Click load unpacked
4. Open the folder including all the files here
5. Done :), make sure to pin the extension to your chrome to be able to use it quickly.

How to use:
Super basic and simple, click the extension, you'll see "add new task", just click it and type your own list of tasks to do and click save.
You will see it there now as a list.

You can also strike out the task that you are done with by clicking the ‚úîÔ∏è button
To remove task simply click the üóëÔ∏è button and it will be removed from list




SIDE NOTE:
This is really basic and just something fun that I learned about online, it uses the user's localstorage to store the input information sent by user. There is no backend database that collects any information from any user.
